Web3 Authentication Replay Attacks

## Web3 Authentication

Web3 Authentication operates on a challenge-response mechanism. In essence, during the authentication process, users employ their crypto wallets to sign a specific message generated by the website. Once the website verifies this signature, it ascertains the ownership of the corresponding address (public key, account), thereby authenticating the user's identity.

The process is outlined in the figure below:

1. The user accesses the website and clicks on "connect wallet." They then select the appropriate address (public key) to connect.
2. The user initiates Web3 authentication by clicking the "login button."
3. A "Signature Request Page" appears from the wallet, prompting the user to sign a message using the Personal Sign protocol ([EIP-191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191)).
4. After reviewing the message content, the user signs it.
5. The wallet sends the signature back to the website's front-end.
6. The front-end forwards the message, signature, and address (public key) to the server (back-end) for verification.
7. The server verifies these components and issues a token.
8. The browser receives the user token, completing the Web3 authentication process.

## Replay Attack

A secure message should incorporate a `nonce` or `timestamp` to prevent replay attacks. The server must validate the message to ensure its legitimacy.

Without a nonce or proper server-side validation, an attacker could potentially use a previously obtained user signature to access the user's account by replaying the signature.


### foundation.app
https://Foundation.app 

Foundation.app's message structure is vulnerable due to the absence of a nonce. 
This omission exposes the Web3 authentication process to replay attacks.

Message example:
```
Please sign this message to connect to Foundation.
```

### galxe.com
https://galxe.com

The galxe.com's message includes a `Nonce` and `Expiration Time`. However, our findings indicate that the server fails to verify these details. We can use an 'old' message to successfully acquire a user's token.

Message example:

```
galxe.com wants you to sign in with your Ethereum account:
0x36E7C6FeB20A90b07F63863D09cC12C4c9f39064

Sign in with Ethereum to the app.
